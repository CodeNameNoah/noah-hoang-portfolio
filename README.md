This is where you can learn all about me! Please hire me :)

## Description

<!-- Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide: -->

I was eager to create a portfolio to showcase all my projects. In my portfolio you will find many past, current and future projects that will embody the assets of skills I have as a web develoepr.
This project was built to show future employers the extent of my skills and the culimnation of many courses I have taken thus far. Such skills compose of being able to construct a portfolio from scratch and being able to include features to create a responsive portfolio.
My portfolio ultimately educates any like-minded peers on how to refactor, implement semantic tags, and to enhance any site's ranking with satisfied accessibility standards on common search engines.
I was able to learn how to be more efficient with setting up style sheets to be organized to prevent headaches in the future when I may return to borrow or polish my skills.
